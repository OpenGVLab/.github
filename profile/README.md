## Welcome to OpenGVLab! üëã

We are a research group from Shanghai AI Lab focused on Vision-Centric AI research. The GV in our name, OpenGVLab, means general vision, a general understanding of vision, so little effort is needed to adapt to new vision-based tasks.

We develop model architecture and release pre-trained foundation models to the community to motivate further research in this area. We have made promising progress in general vision AI, with ***109 SOTA***üöÄ. In 2022, our open-sourced foundation model 65.5 mAP on the COCO object detection benchmark, 91.1% Top1 accuracy in Kinetics 400, achieved landmarks for AI visionüëÄ tasks for imageüñºÔ∏è and videoüìπ understanding.

Based on solid vision foundations, we have expanded to Multi-Modality models and Generative AIÔºàpartner with Vchitect [Vchitect](https://github.com/vchitect)Ôºâ. We aim to empower individuals and businesses by offering a higher starting point for developing vision-based AI products and lessening the burden of building an AI model from scratch.
